    "# Module 2 Summary: Python Data Structures\n",
    "Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know that: \n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python, we often use tuples to group related data together.Tuples refer to ordered and immutable collections of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tuples are usually written as comma-separated elements in parentheses “()\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can include strings, integers, and floats in tuples and access them using both positive and negative indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can perform operations such as combining, concatenating, and slicing on tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tuples are immutable, so you need to create a new tuple to manipulate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tuples, termed nesting, can include other tuples of complex data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can access elements in a nested tuple through indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lists in Python contain ordered collections of items that can hold elements of different types and are mutable, allowing for versatile data storage and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A list is an ordered sequence, represented with square brackets \"[]\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lists possess mutability, rendering them akin to tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A list can contain strings, integers, and floats; you can nest lists within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can access each element in a list using both positive and negative indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Concatenating or appending a list will result in the modification of the same list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can perform operations such as adding, deleting, splitting, and so forth on a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can separate elements in a list using delimiters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Aliasing occurs when multiple names refer to the same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can also clone a list to create another list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dictionaries in Python are key-value pairs that provide a flexible way to store and retrieve data based on unique keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dictionaries consist of keys and values, both composed of string elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You denote dictionaries using curly brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The keys necessitate immutability and uniqueness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The values may be either immutable or mutable, and they allow duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You separate each key-value pair with a comma, and you can use color highlighting to make the key more visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can assign dictionaries to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You use the key as an argument to retrieve the corresponding value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can make additions and deletions to dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can perform an operation on a dictionary to check the key, which results in a true or false output.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can apply methods to obtain a list of keys and values in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sets in Python are collections of unique elements, useful for tasks such as removing duplicates and performing set operations like union and intersection. Sets lack order.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Curly brackets \"{}\" are helpful for defining elements of a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sets do not contain duplicate items.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A list passed through the set function generates a set containing unique elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You use “Set Operations” to perform actions such as adding, removing, and verifying elements in a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can combine sets using the ampersand \"&\" operator to obtain the common elements from both sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can use the Union function to combine two sets, including both the common and unique elements from both sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sub-set method is used to determine if two or more sets are subsets."
